## NetBeans plugin "Open in Explorer"
To install, download the plugin from Releases section, in NetBeans go to
`Menu -> Tool -> Plugins -> Downloaded -> Add Plugins` and install.

Now when you right click a folder in `Files` explorer or a java package in `Project`
explorer, you'll have a new action at the bottom to open your default system
file-explorer (i.e. Explorer on Windows, Finder on Mac, etc.)  

### Requirements
There are no pre-requisites, should work with any version of NetBeans, however
it was built with 8.1 and has not been tested with other versions.


#### Enjoy
